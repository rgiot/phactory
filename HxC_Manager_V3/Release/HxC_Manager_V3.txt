=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Q: What is this software?
A: This software allow to bind .HFE disc images to the 15 HxC's slots

Q: This is version 3. What is the change-log?
A: This is new MAJOR version. It's a complete rewrite of the manager.
   History:
   - V1 (2010): the tool originally created by JF Del Nero. While working,
     the tool was slow
   - V2.X (2011): Enhanced V1. UI got major speed improvements,
     some new features were added but internal core remained V1.
   - this V3 (2013): core internally rewritten (ported to Phactory IDE),
     now using latest SDCC 3.X (was 2.X), new user interface (thanks Ced!),
     removed all the crap and added just the necessary :)
	 Also, some appreciated bug-fixes:
	  - correctly restore HxC's default state when leaving the manager
	  - when quitting the manager, it now directly leaves to BASIC
	    instead of resetting the machine. You saved 2 seconds, yayyy!
	    (this was only possible thanks to proper memory management)
		
Q: Where are the instructions to use the tool?
A: It's actually embedded within the tool, press H key to see the following:
     S: slot list
     Up/Down/Keft/Right: navigate
     Ctrl+Left/Ctrl+Right: prev/next slot
     Space/Enter: select
     ESC: quit
		
Q: How good is the memory usage?
A: When you launch the DISC version (run"HXC") the whole BASIC area till &9900 is used.
   When you launch the ROM version (|HXC) RAM between &1A80 and &9900 is used
    (ROM only serves as storage, the tool is not really executed from ROM)
	
Q: Can I use the manager with my 464-664?
A: Yes, the program is 64Kb-compatible. Of course, 464 owners still need
   a FDC controller (provided through DDI-1 interface).
   
Q: V3 is fantastic. Now I want filtering, sorting, edit HxC's device settings, 
   use my HxC as an external hard-driv...
A: No. Clearly, with V3 the aim is to provide a unique version of the tool
   to last for years! Due to that, I did my best at keeping it as simple as possible.
   So the HxC Floppy Emulator Manager... only manage files, sorry :)
   You will have to use your PC to edit HxC's device settings and more.
   Also,
   HxC Manager V3 is pretty advanced for a Z80 CPU 3Mhz! The HxC provides disc access,
   but it's still the CPC's CPU to decode and parse Fat32 file system! 
   If you want parsing and sorting on, let's say, 200 files in a folder, 
   this would take something like 45-60 seconds.. not sure it would be comfortable
   experience :)
